This repository contains two levels of Azure Function's examples.

1) All folders within the root of the repository are manually created and maintained function source files with Visual Studio Code. Each folder represents a single function and the code within to execute.

2) The 'vs' folder is a sub-directory that contains an example Visual Studio solution on how to build & deploy an Azure Function within Visual Studio.
